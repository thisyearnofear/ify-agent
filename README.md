# WOWOWIFY Agent

A Next.js application that provides AI-powered image generation using the Venice AI API, with built-in rate limiting and metrics tracking. It enables image overlays with predefined styles, logos, and filters as well as enabling the user to user their own images as overlays.

## Agent Integration

WOWOWIFY Agent can be controlled via natural language commands through its API, allowing external services to generate and manipulate images without interacting with the UI.

```bash
# Example: Generate an image with a wowowify overlay
curl -X POST https://your-app.com/api/agent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "command": "Generate an image of a mountain landscape and add the wowowify overlay"
  }'
```

The agent understands commands like:

- "Generate an image of [description]"
- "Apply the [style] overlay" (styles: degenify, higherify, wowowify, scrollify, lensify, higherise, dickbuttify, nikefy, nounify, baseify, clankerify, mantleify)
- "Position at [x], [y]"
- "Scale to [size]"
- "Set color to [color]"
- "Set opacity to [value]"

You can also provide structured parameters to override NLP extraction:

```json
{
  "command": "Generate a futuristic city",
  "parameters": {
    "overlayMode": "degenify",
    "controls": {
      "scale": 1.2,
      "x": 0,
      "y": 0,
      "overlayColor": "#ffffff",
      "overlayAlpha": 0.8
    }
  }
}
```

## Deployment

The application is optimized for deployment on Vercel:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import the project in Vercel
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy!

### Deployment Considerations

When deploying to Vercel or other serverless environments, keep these important points in mind:

1. **Serverless Function Timeouts**:

   - Vercel functions have a default timeout of 10 seconds (Hobby plan) or 60 seconds (Pro plan)
   - Our application implements its own timeout handling to prevent hanging requests
   - If you experience timeouts, consider upgrading to a Pro plan

2. **Memory Storage**:

   - Images are stored in memory rather than the filesystem in production
   - This is because serverless functions have ephemeral filesystems
   - Images are automatically cleaned up to prevent memory leaks
   - Users should download images they want to keep

3. **Error Handling**:

   - The application implements robust error handling for API responses
   - Frontend code checks content types before parsing JSON
   - Detailed error messages are provided to help diagnose issues

4. **Architecture Notes**:

   - The agent route directly calls the Venice API to reduce API hops
   - Overlay images are loaded from public URLs rather than the filesystem
   - All image processing happens within a single serverless function

5. **Troubleshooting**:
   - If you see "Unexpected token" errors, it's likely a JSON parsing issue
   - Check that all API responses are properly formatted as JSON
   - Ensure timeouts are properly handled with AbortController
   - Verify that all environment variables are correctly set in Vercel

## Grove Integration

The application integrates with Grove, a secure, flexible, onchain-controlled storage layer for Web3 apps. When using the "lensify" overlay, the generated image is stored both in memory and on Grove.

### How it works

1. When a user requests an image with the "lensify" overlay, the application processes the image as usual.
2. After processing, the image is stored in memory like other overlays.
3. Additionally, the image is uploaded to Grove using the `@lens-chain/storage-client` library.
4. The response includes both the standard image URLs and Grove-specific URIs and URLs.
5. The UI displays Grove information when available, allowing users to access their images through Grove.

### Benefits

- **Persistent Storage**: Unlike in-memory storage, Grove provides more persistent storage for images.
- **Web3 Integration**: Images stored on Grove can be referenced in Web3 applications.
- **Access Control**: Grove supports various access control mechanisms for uploaded content.

## Farcaster Integration

### Farcaster Bot

The bot can process commands when mentioned in a Farcaster cast. It works in two ways:

#### Generating New Images with Overlays

- `@snel Generate a mountain landscape` - Generates a new image with the default overlay (Stable Diffusion)
- `@snel degenify a futuristic city. scale to 0.5` - Generates an image with the degenify overlay
- `@snel higherify a beach sunset. opacity to 0.7` - Generates an image with the higherify overlay
- `@snel scrollify a minimalist tech background. color to blue` - Generates an image with the scrollify overlay
- `@snel lensify a professional portrait. scale to 0.4` - Generates an image with the lensify overlay
- `@snel higherise a cityscape. scale to 0.6` - Generates an image with the higherise overlay
- `@snel dickbuttify a meme template. position at 10, 20` - Generates an image with the dickbuttify overlay
- `@snel nikefy a sports scene. opacity to 0.8` - Generates an image with the nikefy overlay
- `@snel nounify a cartoon character. scale to 0.5` - Generates an image with the nounify overlay
- `@snel baseify a crypto-themed image. color to blue` - Generates an image with the baseify overlay
- `@snel clankerify a robot scene. scale to 0.7` - Generates an image with the clankerify overlay
- `@snel mantleify a blockchain visualization. scale to 0.5` - Generates an image with the mantleify overlay

#### Applying Overlays to Existing Images

When replying to a cast with an image:

- `@snel degenify this image` - Applies the degenify overlay to the image in the parent cast
- `@snel higherify this. scale to 0.3` - Applies the higherify overlay with scaling
- `@snel scrollify. position at 10, 20` - Applies the scrollify overlay with positioning
- `@snel lensify this photo. opacity to 0.5` - Applies the lensify overlay with opacity adjustment
- `@snel overlay with degenify. color to red` - Applies the degenify overlay with color adjustment
- `@snel higherise this` - Applies the higherise overlay to the parent image
- `@snel dickbuttify this photo` - Applies the dickbuttify overlay to the parent image
- `@snel nikefy. scale to 0.4` - Applies the nikefy overlay with scaling
- `@snel nounify this. position at 20, 30` - Applies the nounify overlay with positioning
- `@snel baseify this image. opacity to 0.6` - Applies the baseify overlay with opacity adjustment
- `@snel clankerify. color to green` - Applies the clankerify overlay with color adjustment
- `@snel mantleify this image. scale to 0.4` - Applies the mantleify overlay with scaling

The bot is smart enough to understand that when you reply to a cast and use phrases like "this image", "this photo", or simply specify an overlay mode, you want to apply the overlay to the image in the parent cast.

### Customization Options

All overlays can be customized with the following parameters:

- **Scale**: `scale to 0.5` - Adjusts the size of the overlay (0.1 to 2.0)
- **Position**: `position at 10, 20` - Sets the X,Y coordinates of the overlay
- **Color**: `color to red` - Changes the color filter of the overlay
- **Opacity**: `opacity to 0.7` - Adjusts the transparency of the overlay (0.0 to 1.0)

### Storage

All images generated by the bot are stored on Grove for persistence, ensuring that they remain accessible even after the temporary URLs expire. The bot always replies with the Grove URL when available, providing a reliable link to the generated image.

When an image is generated or processed:

1. The image is first stored temporarily in memory
2. It is then uploaded to Grove, a decentralized storage solution
3. The Grove URL is included in the bot's reply
4. This URL is permanent and can be accessed indefinitely

This approach ensures that your images remain accessible long after the interaction with the bot, making it ideal for sharing and referencing images in the future.

### Setup

1. Create a Neynar account at [neynar.com](https://neynar.com) and get an API key
2. Create a Farcaster bot and get a signer UUID
3. Configure environment variables in your deployment:
   ```
   NEYNAR_API_KEY=your_neynar_api_key
   FARCASTER_SIGNER_UUID=your_farcaster_signer_uuid
   FARCASTER_BOT_FID=your_bot_fid
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app-url.com
   NEYNAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
   ```
4. Set up a webhook in the Neynar dashboard:
   - Event: `cast.created`
   - Filter: `mentioned_fids` = your bot's FID
   - Target URL: `https://your-app-url.com/api/farcaster/webhook`

### Access Control

By default, the bot is configured to respond only to authorized users. This is managed through a Redis-based allowed users list, which can be updated via the admin API. This ensures that the bot's resources are used only by approved users during testing and early deployment phases.

#### Managing the Allowlist

The allowlist is a list of Farcaster FIDs (Farcaster IDs) that are authorized to use the bot. You can manage this list using the admin API:

1. **View the current allowlist**:

   ```bash
   curl "https://your-app-url.com/api/farcaster/allowed-users?apiKey=YOUR_ADMIN_API_KEY"
   ```

2. **Add users to the allowlist**:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://your-app-url.com/api/farcaster/allowed-users?apiKey=YOUR_ADMIN_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"users": [5254, 8685, 323496, 7316]}'
   ```

   This will replace the existing allowlist with the new list of FIDs. Make sure to include all existing FIDs you want to keep, plus any new ones.

3. **Find a user's FID**:
   - You can find a user's FID by visiting their Warpcast profile and looking at the URL: `https://warpcast.com/username`
   - Or by using the Neynar API: `curl -H "api_key: YOUR_NEYNAR_API_KEY" "https://api.neynar.com/v2/farcaster/user/search?q=username"`

The `ADMIN_API_KEY` is set as an environment variable in your deployment. Make sure to keep this key secure and only share it with trusted administrators.

### Testing

You can test the webhook locally using the provided test script:

```bash
WEBHOOK_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/farcaster/webhook \
FARCASTER_BOT_FID=123456 \
COMMAND="lensify a mountain landscape" \
node scripts/test-farcaster-webhook.js
```

To test the image overlay functionality specifically, you can use:

```bash
WEBHOOK_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/farcaster/webhook \
FARCASTER_BOT_FID=123456 \
COMMAND="degenify this image" \
node scripts/test-farcaster-webhook.js
```

### Farcaster Frames

The application now supports Farcaster Frames, allowing users to interact with the image overlay tool directly within Farcaster clients. This provides a seamless experience for users to:

- wowowifys with overlays without leaving Farcaster
- Connect their wallet for additional functionality
- Access the full application with a single tap

#### Using the Frame

1. Visit the frame URL: `https://wowowifyer.vercel.app/frames`
2. The frame will appear in Farcaster clients with a button to open the interactive interface
3. Once opened, you can:
   - Select an overlay mode
   - Enter a prompt for image generation
   - wowowifys directly within the frame
   - Connect your wallet for additional functionality
   - Open the full application if needed

#### Frame Development

The frame is built using:

- `@farcaster/frame-sdk` - Official Farcaster Frame SDK
- `@farcaster/frame-wagmi-connector` - Wallet connector for Farcaster Frames
- `wagmi` and `viem` - For wallet interactions

The frame implementation follows the Farcaster Frames v2 specification, providing a rich interactive experience within Farcaster clients.
